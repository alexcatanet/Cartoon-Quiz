# Cartoon Quiz

This Quiz App project was a chance for me to combine and practice everything I've learned in the scholarship program (Android Basics by Google).
The goal was to create an educational app that quizzes a user about a certain topic at my choice. I tried to be creative as it was possible at that moment.

## What I've learned:

This project is about combining various ideas and skills I've been practicing throughout the course. They include:

- Planning my app design before coding.

- Taking an app layout from drawing to XML code.

- Creating, positioning, and styling views.

- Creating interactivity through button clicks and Java code.

- Commenting and documenting the code.

## Project Specification

-  The App contains 6 questions, it includes 4 radio buttons, one checkbox, and one text entry.

- The App includes a button for the user to submit their answers and receive a score.

- The app gracefully handles displaying all the content on screen when rotated.

- The grading button displays a toast which accurately displays the results of the quiz.

- The grading logic checks each answer correctly. The app accurately computes the number of correct answers and does not include incorrect answers in the count.
